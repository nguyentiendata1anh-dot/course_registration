1. User Interface Components:
   - Login/Signup: Handles user authentication via Devise
   - Course List: Displays available courses with enrollment options
   - Student Dashboard: Shows enrolled courses, GPA, credits
   - Admin Panel: Manages users, courses, grades
   - Gradebook: Interface for entering student scores

2. Business Logic Components:
   - Authentication: Manages user sessions and roles
   - Enrollment Rules: Validates prerequisites, capacity, conflicts
   - Grade Calculation: Computes GPA, letter grades from scores
   - Schedule Conflict Detection: Checks for time overlaps

3. Data Access Components:
   - Repositories: Encapsulate database queries for each model
   - User Repository: Handles user profile, roles, enrollments
   - Course Repository: Manages course details, sections, terms
   - Enrollment Repository: Tracks student registrations and grades

4. Infrastructure Components:
   - Controllers: Route requests, coordinate between UI and business logic
   - Models: Represent data entities with validations and associations
   - Database: Persistent storage with relational integrity
   - Views: Render HTML responses using ERB templates
   - Helpers: Provide reusable view logic and formatting
   - External Services: Handle emails, file uploads, background processing

Key Relationships:
- Controllers depend on Models for data operations
- Models use Database for persistence
- Views depend on Controllers for data and Helpers for formatting
- Business Logic components are used by Controllers
- Data Access components are used by Models and Controllers
- External Services are triggered by Controllers and Models
