Key Components:
- User Authentication: Devise gem for login/signup
- Authorization: Role-based (Student/Admin)
- Routing: RESTful routes defined in config/routes.rb
- Database: Relational database with migrations
- External Interfaces: Email notifications, file uploads (Active Storage)

Data Flow:
1. User sends HTTP request to Rails app
2. Routes direct to appropriate controller action
3. Controller interacts with models for business logic
4. Models query/update database via Active Record
5. Controller renders appropriate view template
6. View is sent back as HTML response to user
